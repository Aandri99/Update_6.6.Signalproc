############################################################################

=================
Goals of this Lab
=================

1. Demonstrate ability to use Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, and Spectrum Analyzer capabilities of Red Pitaya through GUI.

2. Configure Red pitaya to receive external inputs.

3. Perform measurements on a multitude of periodic waveforms

====================
Tasks / Measurements
====================

Configure the Red Pitaya for a Loopback configuration (SMA cables tied between the outputs and inputs to the Red Pitaya) as shown in Fig. 1.

Measure the Period of a waveform – Time Domain
----------------------------------------------

Open the Oscilloscope & function Generator Application.

Configure the output of the red pitaya for a 1500Hz Sinusoid as shown in Fig. 2.

Configure the trigger for a negative edge trigger with zero level and normal trigger mode as shown in Fig. 3.

Enable OUT1. You should now see a figure close to the following

To measure the period,

1. Select the “Cursor” box, and enable “X1”, “X2” options.

2. Drag each cursor to a common feature of the waveform (peak to peak, trough to trough)

3. Read off spacing between cursors. This is an approximate measure of the period

Period can also be measured by the red pitaya itself, under the meas command by selecting “Period” and “IN2”, and finally selecting “Done”.
This is shown in Fig. 5.

Measure the Fundamental Frequency of a waveform – Time Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------

To measure the fundamental frequency of a waveform, bring up the X1,X2 cursors, and select a single period of the waveform. From there you can use the following relation to estimate the frequency of the waveform.:

.. math::
   \begin{matrix}
   f = \frac{1}{T}\ \#(1) \\
   \end{matrix}

to estimate the frequency of the waveform.

Once again, the Red pitaya can also calculate this by selecting the “FREQ” measurement option in the “Meas” options as shown below.

Measure the Phase between two waveforms – Time Domain
-----------------------------------------------------

Select output 2, and select the second output to be a 1500 Hz sine wave with a 45 degree phase shift

.. image:: media/image1.07.png
   :name: Second channel configuration
..   :align: center

Configure the trigger for a single shot acquisition as shown in Fig. 8.

   :name: Trigger configuration

Fig. 8: Trigger configuration

Acquire a single capture, and measure the frequency and period of each waveform as previously described. Note that for the second channel, you
may want to specify your cursors to track channel 2 in the cursor menu. To measure the Phase between waveforms, simply calculate the difference
in time between two corresponding peaks between waveforms, and convert this to their corresponding difference in angular frequency. This can be
calculated for signals of equal frequency with the relation

.. math::
   \begin{matrix}
   \phi = 2\pi f\Delta t\ \ \ (rad)\ \#(2) \\
   \end{matrix}

1. Analytically calculate the period of either waveform, and the time delay expected for the configured 45 degree phase shift between waveforms.

2. Set the output frequency of a OUT1 to 1000 Hz and trigger to normal or auto. What is the behavior that is observed? Comment as to the origin of the behavior, and a potential fix for the behavior. (hint,consider the greatest common divisor between the two frequencies)

3. (Take home) Repeat part 2, but for the frequency values of 3000Hz, and 1531Hz. What behavior is displayed here for each frequency? What are some potential ways to work around this problem? (hint, consider the greatest common divisor between the two frequencies, and
   alternative trigger modes)

Measure the Spectrum of the waveform - Frequency Domain
-------------------------------------------------------

Open the DFT Spectrum Analyzer Application.

Recreate the waveform employed in 2.1. For convenience, this is reprinted below:

1. Configure the output of the red pitaya for a 1500Hz Sinusoid as shown
   in Fig. 2.

Set the Span of the spectrum analyzer to 6.5 kHz.

Observe the location of the peak(s), and infer what this implies about the sinusoid’s fundamental frequency and its purity (harmonic content). Mention the relative strength between the various peaks in dB and in linear scales, knowing the relation between dB and linear scales in dBm is given by:

.. math::
   \begin{matrix}
   P_{dBm} = 10\log_{10}\frac{P_{lin}}{1mW}\ \#(3) \\
   \end{matrix}

Comparing Waveforms in the Time domain
--------------------------------------

Configure the Red Pitaya for a Loopback configuration (SMA cables tied between the outputs and inputs to the Red Pitaya) as shown in Fig. 1.

Reference Case: Sine and Cosine

Set OUT1 and OUT2 to be sines of the same frequency of 1000Hz, with equal amplitude. Set OUT2 to have a phase of 90 degrees.
